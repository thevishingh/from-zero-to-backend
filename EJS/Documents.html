What is EJS?

EJS (Embedded JavaScript) is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup
with plain JavaScript. It allows you to embed JavaScript code into your HTML files, making it easy to create dynamic content.
EJS is often used in web applications to render views on the server side before sending them to
the client. It is particularly useful for generating HTML pages that include data from a database or other sources.
EJS files typically have a `.ejs` file extension and can include JavaScript code within `<% %>` tags.
